module{clk, rst, choice, in_mny, prd, chng}

INPUTS:
1. Clock signal {clk}
   All the workings will take place only on Positive edge of the clock.

2. Reset(1 bit) {rst}
   If reset is 1 then machine will start from initial state.

3. Choice(2 bits) {choice}
   In choice we have four options to select so we need atleast 2 bits to represent them,
   these choices will be four different products to be chosen from the vending machine, they will be 
   represented as:
   1st product--00--Juice can
   2nd product--01--Biscuits
   3rd product--10--Water bottle
   4th product--11--Chips packet

4. Money(2 bits) {in_mny}
   A vending machine can accept only Rs.5, Rs.10 and Rs.20 notes/coins or a no money option if there is 
   no input of money. so we need atlest 2 bits to represent the money taken as input,
   they will be represented as,
   No money--00
   Rs.5    --01
   Rs.10   --10
   Rs.20   --11

OUTPUTS:
1. Product recieved(3 bits) {prd}
   There can be five product outputs, if a customer successfully completes the payment he will recieve his/her chosen
   product among the four(four outputs) and if he fails to complete the payment he will recieve nothing(no product)
   so there are total 5 outcomes of product recieved, so we need atleast 3 bits to represent them, 
   they will be
   1st Output--Nothing    --000
   2nd Output--1st product--001
   3rd Output--2nd product--010
   4th Output--3rd product--011
   5th output--4th product--100

2. Change recieved(2 bits) {chng}
   A custoomer will recieve his/her money back if he/she exceeds the payment of the product chosen and also if 
   he is unable to complete the payment of a given product in given time. Change recieved can be Rs.0, Rs.5, Rs.10 and 
   Rs.15 to represent these change recieved we need atleast 2 bits, they will be represented as
   Rs.0--00
   Rs.5--01
   Rs.10--10
   Rs.15--11

FUNCTIONALITY and SCOPING:
There will be four parameters representing the states of the machines,
S0:Initial state
S1:Machine has recieved a total of Rs.5
S2:Machine has recieved a total of Rs.10
S3:Machine has recieved a total of Rs.15

Two parameters will be used to represent currant and next state,
c_state and n_state.



Example-->
If a customer choses to buy a product, let he/she wants to buy a water bottle(2'b10) of Rs.15 then first he/she would have to select the product on the machine and then start paying from initial state S0, if he puts Rs.5 then the machine will reach in state S1 with prd output 000 and chng output 00, then he/she puts Rs.5 again then the machine will reach in state S2 with prd output 000 and chng output 00, now if he/she puts Rs.10 more then he/she has paid a total of Rs.20 for a water bottle of price Rs.15 so now the machine will return to state S0 with prd output 010 and chng output 01.

Similarly for every product case customer will recieve his/her product and change of money from the machine. The machine works on Mealey finite-state machine.

The scope of this project is to ease the procces of buying and reducing the man labour at shop by a simple machine that accepts the payment and returns the product wanted by the customer.
